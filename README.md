# â˜€â˜€This is the replication package of all our dataset and experiment code.

# Dataset Description

The data in the .xlsx and .csv format in the project is the data set for our analysis. Each column in the dataset clearly indicates the meaning of the data.


ðŸ˜„please note that: since the amount of original data of the github projects and SO posts is too large (more than 100GB) to upload to the cloud. Please contact our email if necessary and we will send it.

# Experimental Environment
Programming Language: Python3.

Primary dependency library: Pandas, Matplotlib, Gensim, NLTK.


# How to use the code we provide to reproduce our analysis process?
## ðŸš€Step 1ï¼š
First, please download the dataset and put it under the corresponding path according to the code.
## ðŸš€Step 2ï¼š
We have put the analysis codes corresponding to different RQs in their respective folders, and the analysis codes are stored in (.py) and (.ipynb) python file formats.You can get the experimental results of our paper by running the corresponding code file.
